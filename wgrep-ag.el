;;; Commentary:

;; wgrep-ag allows you to edit a ag buffer and apply those changes to
;; the file buffer.

;;; Install:

;; 1. Install ag.el
;;
;;   https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el

;; 2. Install wgrep.el

;; 3. Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and byte compile it if
;; desired. And put the following expression into your ~/.emacs.
;;
;;     (autoload 'wgrep-ag-setup "wgrep-ag")
;;     (add-hook 'ag-mode-hook 'wgrep-ag-setup)

;;; Usage:

;; See wgrep.el

;;; Code:

(require 'wgrep)

;;;###autoload
(defun wgrep-ag-setup ()
  ;; ag.el prints a column number too, so we catch that
  ;; if it exists.  Here \2 is a colon + whitespace separator.  This
  ;; might need to change if (caar grep-regexp-alist) does.
  (set (make-local-variable 'wgrep-line-file-regexp)
       (concat
        wgrep-default-line-header-regexp
        "\\(?:\\([1-9][0-9]*\\)\\2\\)?"))
  (wgrep-setup-internal))

;;;###autoload
(add-hook 'ag-mode-hook 'wgrep-ag-setup)

;; For `unload-feature'
(defun wgrep-ag-unload-function ()
  (remove-hook 'ag-mode-hook 'wgrep-ag-setup))

(provide 'wgrep-ag)

;;; wgrep-ag.el ends here

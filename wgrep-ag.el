;;; Commentary:

;; wgrep-ag allows you to edit a ag buffer and apply those changes to
;; the file buffer.

;;; Install:

;; 1. Install ag.el
;;
;;   https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el

;; 2. Install wgrep.el

;; 3. Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and byte compile it if
;; desired. And put the following expression into your ~/.emacs.
;;
;;     (autoload 'wgrep-ag-setup "wgrep-ag")
;;     (add-hook 'ag-mode-hook 'wgrep-ag-setup)

;;; Usage:

;; See wgrep.el

;;; Code:
